My overall project through steps:
1. Initial Basic Todo Application where we can add a todo also setting priority for that todo then upload it.
	- added update feature.
	- added Swipe to delete feature.
2. Added a buttomsheetfragment for the app and added calendar to set the date.
3. Added a top row bar to modify the top row of the application.
4. Added menu kebab option to add a simple second activity "About"
5. Modified colors for the normal mode and dark mode of the application supporting both themes according to the mobile settings.
